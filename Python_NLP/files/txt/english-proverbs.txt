Two wrongs don't make a right.
The pen is mightier than the sword.
When the going gets tough, the tough get going.
No man is an island.
Fortune favors the bold.
People who live in glass houses should not throw stones.
Hope for the best, but prepare for the worst.
Better late than never.
Birds of a feather flock together.
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer.
Never look a gift horse in the mouth.
You can't make an omelet without breaking a few eggs.
Practice makes perfect.
If you can't beat 'em, join 'em.
