# Coordinating Conjunction
They join together words, phrases, and independent clauses. With them, short and choppy
sentences can be joined into fuller lines. There are seven of them, and they're easy to
remember if you can just think of the acronym "FANBOYS."

*) For - Explains reason or purpose (just like "because")
*) And - Adds one thing to another
*) Nor - Used to present an alternative negative idea to an already stated negative idea
*) But - Shows contrast
*) Or - Presents an alternative or a choice
*) Yet - Introduces a contrasting idea that follows the preceding idea logically
*) So - Indicates effect, result or consequence

# Subordinating Conjunction
A subordinating conjunction always introduces a dependent clause, tying it to an independent clause.
A dependent clause is a group of words that cannot stand alone as a complete sentence. An independent clause,
by contrast, can stand alone as a complete sentence.

*) although
*) as
*) because
*) before
*) how
*) if
*) once
*) since
*) than
*) that
*) though
*) until
*) when
*) whenever
*) where
*) whether
*) while
*) why

# Correlative Conjunctions
Correlative conjunctions are tag-team conjunctions. They come in pairs,
and you have to use both of them in different places in a sentence to make them work.
These conjunctions work together (co-) and relate one sentence to another.
Correlative conjunctions connect two equal grammatical terms.

*) both/and
*) whether/or
*) either/or
*) neither/nor
*) not/but
*) not only/but also
